    // following:
    //  1) Delete player from configured indices.  This effectively removes the
    //     player from matchmaking when using recommended MMF patterns.
    //     Everything after this is just cleanup to save stage storage space.
    //  2) 'Lazily' delete the player's state storage record.  This is kicked
    //     off in the background and may take some time to complete.
    //  2) 'Lazily' delete the player's metadata indicies (like, the timestamp when 
    //     they called CreatePlayer, and the last time the record was accessed).  This 
    //     is also kicked off in the background and may take some time to complete.

    // Calls to access matchmaking results for a player

    // GetUpdates streams matchmaking results from Open Match for the
    // provided player ID.
    // INPUT: Player message with the 'id' field populated.
    // OUTPUT: a stream of player objects with one or more of the following
    // fields populated, if an update to that field is seen in state storage:
    //  - 'assignment': string that usually contains game server connection information.
    //  - 'status': string to communicate current matchmaking status to the client.
    //  - 'error': string to pass along error information to the client.
    //
    // During normal operation, the expectation is that the 'assignment' field
    // will be updated by a Backend process calling the 'CreateAssignments' Backend API
    // endpoint.  'Status' and 'Error' are free for developers to use as they see fit.  
    // Even if you had multiple players enter a matchmaking request as a group, the
    // Backend API 'CreateAssignments' call will write the results to state
    // storage separately under each player's ID. OM expects you to make all game
    // clients 'GetUpdates' with their own ID from the Frontend API to get
    // their results.
    //
    // NOTE: This call generates a small amount of load on the Frontend API and state
    //  storage while watching the player record for updates. You are expected
    //  to close the stream from your client after receiving your matchmaking
    //  results (or a reasonable timeout), or you will continue to
    //  generate load on OM until you do!
    // NOTE: Just bear in mind that every update will send egress traffic from
    //  Open Match to game clients! Frugality is recommended.
