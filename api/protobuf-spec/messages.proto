// Open Match's internal representation and wire protocol format for "MatchObjects".
// In order to request a match using the Backend API, your backend code should generate
// a new MatchObject with an ID and properties filled in (for more details about valid
// values for these fields, see the documentation).  Open Match then sends the Match
// Object through to your matchmaking function, where you add players to 'rosters' and
// store any schemaless data you wish in the 'properties' field.  The MatchObject
// is then sent, populated, out through the Backend API to your backend code.
// 
// MatchObjects contain a number of fields, but many gRPC calls that take a
// MatchObject as input only require a few of them to be filled in.  Check the
// gRPC function in question for more details.
