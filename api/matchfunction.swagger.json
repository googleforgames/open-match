Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics."

Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": \u003cstring\u003e,\n      \"lastName\": \u003cstring\u003e\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }"

The error code should be an enum value of\n[google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code], but it may accept additional error codes\nif needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message\nthat helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized\nuser-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error\ndetails or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain\narbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error\ndetail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error\nconditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",
