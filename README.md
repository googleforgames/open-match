Open Match is an open source game matchmaking framework that simplifies building
a scalable and extensible Matchmaker. It is designed to give the game developer
full control over how to make matches while removing the burden of dealing with
the challenges of running a production service at scale.

Please visit [Open Match website](https://open-match.dev/site/docs/) for user
documentation, demo instructions etc.
